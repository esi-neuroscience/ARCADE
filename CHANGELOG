# Change Log of ARCADE

## Unreleased
### NEW
*   Square wave grating with anti-aliased bands and mask
*   StimServer v1.3.1.1: anti-aliased Ellipse and Rectangle stimuli with
    support for outlines
*   BinaryEyelinkServer:
*   Support for MATLAB > 2014a
*   NidaqServer v.1.0.10.2: support for PCIe-6251 and PCIe-6321

### CHANGED
*   Circle stimulus is now a child of Ellipse with different properties than 
    before (radius instead of diameter, faceColor and edgeColor instead of color)
*   Extended documentation: all user-facing functions and classes have extensive
    documentation of all releveant methods and properties.

## [2.4.0] - 2018-06-15
### NEW
*   A petal-like shape stimulus can now be created using the Petal class
    The total reward issued during a session can now be retreived using the MATLAB function totalRewardtime
*   Improved documentation for helper functions and stimuli


## [2.3.0] - 2018-05-17
### NEW
*   MotionPicture stimuli trigger an event when playback has finished, with
    the name stored in the MotionPicture.endEventName property

### FIXED
*   Animations: De-assigning already finished/de-assigned animations was
    crashing StimServer
*   MotionPicture stimuli were played at half the specified frame rate
    (MotionPicture.screenFramesPerVideoFrame)
*   The specified MotionPicture frame rate was not stored in the MATLAB
    object.

## [2.3.0b2] - 2018-05-04
### CHANGED
*   Default size of PixelShader-based stimuli is now 50x50 px. Shader size is
    automatically increased on demand in Grating and Gabor if radius exceeds
    current shader size
*   Direction of maskRotation parameter of Gabor has been inverted. It used to
    be defined opposite of the Gabor.direction parameter

### FIXED
*   StimServer: changes to stimuli occuring after the end of a deferred mode
    (groupstimli('end')) but before the next frame were ignored. These are now
    also applied with the next frame.
*   Obsolete shader code in Gabor and Grating has been removed


## [2.3.0b1] - 2018-04-13
### NEW
*   Handmapper: an ARCADE add-on for manual receptive field mapping, which can
    be started via arcade/AddOns/Handmapper/RFhandmapper.bat
*   bring_to_front: The drawing order of overlapping stimuli can now be
    adjusted by bringing individual stimuli to the frontmost layer using the
    bring_to_front method.
*   Flicker animation: stimuli can be turned on and off periodically for
    speficied number of frames
*   MotionPicture stimulus (alpha version): image sequences stored in a multi-
    frame TIFF file can be presented as movies. Use
    convert_video_for_StimServer to convert compressed movie files to an
    uncompressed TIFF.
*   NidaqServer: logging option for debugging event-triggered reward
*   Function for plotting a state flow diagram based on trialscript code
*   State: set and get methods for duration and elapsedTime to determine State
    duration at runtime
*   StateRuntimeVariable: a class for holding and retreiving data created at
    runtime of the session, e.g. reaction times. See help StateRuntimeVariable
*   Improvements for CalibrateEyelink: reward is now coupled to advancing to
    the next calibration target, reward and stimulus visibility can be
    triggered via hotkeys

### CHANGED
*   Grating: the spatialFrequency property was renamed to spatialPeriod as it
    was actually specifying the period in px/cycle. spatialFrequency will
    still work but produce a warning

### FIXED
*   Editable variables where not removed from the configuration file when they
    were removed from the GUI    
*   Manually adding files to backup in main GUI deleted existing files


## [2.2.0] - 2018-01-10
### NEW
*   EyelinkEyeServer: positions tracked via trackeye are not drawn on the
    Eyelink Host PC's screen.
*   A stimulus position can now be coupled to a coordinate stored in shared
    memory using the animation ExternalPositionControl. This allows for
    example gaze-contingent stimulus presentation and manual receptive field
    mapping.
*   The next state after the maximum number of repetitions of a State can now
    be defined using the nextStateAfterMaxRepetitions property.

### CHANGED
*   Updated the MovingBar class: Playing the bar animation is now triggered
    via MovingBar.play_animation() (see help MovingBar). Also, the animation
    of the bar is now configured by default to trigger the
    StimServerAnimationDone event once the bar has reached it's final
    position.

### FIXED
*   Setting the background color for the pause screen had no effect.
*   Trialscripts that do not use the createTrial function, i.e. put States
    into the StateArc, crashed ARCADE.

## [2.1.4] - 2018-01-08
### FIXED
*   StimServer 1.2.5.1: deleting PixelShader-based stimuli (gratings, gammatrons, 
    gaussians, gabors)) without making them visible was crashing StimServer.exe 
    in 1.2.4.0 and 1.2.5.0 (ARCADE 2.0.2-2.1.3)

## [2.1.3] - 2017-12-18
### FIXED
*   Bugs due to renaming of NidaqServer to DaqServer
*   Due to MATLAB black magic, states lasted ca. 10% longer than defined by
    the user. Timings of eventmarkers etc. should still have been correct.
    This is fixed with a workaround now. It will be fixed more elegantly in a
    future version of ARCADE.

## [2.1.2] - 2017-11-15
### NEW
*   NidaqServer.exe: support for USB-6353

### FIXED
*   Bugs introduced due to renaming NidaqServer

## [2.1.1] - 2017-11-02
### FIXED
*   NidaqServer.exe 1.0.8.0 sends sufficiently long and spaced eventmarkers for
    TDT's RZ2 (40 microseconds)

## [2.1.0] - 2017-10-30
### NEW
*   Gabor stimulus
*   NidaqServer can be configured to give out an event marker for manual rewards
*   Added tutorial documentation for digital input/output

### CHANGED
*   Animations should now be played and stopped via the play_animation and
    stop_animation methods of a stimulus. Using the animation property is
    still supported but deprecated.
*   Default terminal action of animations now 0, i.e., the stimulus persists
    after the animation
*   getPreviousTrialdata now also returns user variables stored with
    storeUserVariables

### FIXED
*   Wrong path of pixel shader file of Gammatron stimulus

## [2.0.1] - 2017-09-29
### FIXED
*   Fixed bugs related to CalibrateEyelink

## [2.0.0] - 2017-09-08
### NEW
*   Linear range animation for image alpha values, StimServer 1.2.3.0
*   Flash animation, StimServer 1.2.3.0

### FIXED
*   Wrong file name of trackdigitalinput function

### CHANGED
*   Restructured StimServer folder
*   terminalAction property of Animation is now a binary string or a number

### FIXED
*   Bugs in Rectangle destructor
*   Animations are unassigned in Stimulus destructor

## [2.0.0a3] - 2017-07-14
### CHANGED
*   Eventmarkers are now controlled via NidaqServer.exe (port 0-1, strobe on
    port2/line7 (PCI-6221) or port2/line0 (PCI-6503)
  
### FIXED
*   Bugs in EyelinkEyeServer


## [2.0.0a2] - 2017-07-10
### NEW
*   Helper function for tracking digital input
*   Buttons and hotkeys in ControlScreen for setting an event to skip a trial.
*   NidaqServer.exe 1.0.4.0 sets a RewardDone event when the reward sequence
    is over
*   Example task for tracking a lever

## [2.0.0a1]
### NEW
*   Buttons and hotkeys for reward in ControlScreen
*   Support for arbitrary digital input devices, e.g. levers.
*   NidaqServer for National Instruments Cards PCI(e)-6221 and PCI-6503
*   EyeServer and DaqServer can be selected from the configuration GUI
*   A trial can be terminated after a maximal number of iterations of a
    specific state (maxRepetitions property of State)

### CHANGED
*   Definition of State: states now wait for kernel32 events and select the
    next state according to which event was triggered or a timeout occurred.
    The syntax for State definition has completely changed (see new
    documentation).
*   Reward is delivered via DaqServer
*   Eye position is monitored in EyeServer processes and status signaled via
    events

### REMOVED
*   onRun functionality of States. If necessary this will be re-added later.

##  [1.0.0b3] - 2017-06-21
### NEW
*   Added Gaussian stimulus

### CHANGED
*   Enhanced condition/block selection functions: block selection is evaluated 
    first and its result can be used in the condition selection function as 2nd 
    argument.
*   Updated Grating stimulus to use new shader implementation

### FIXED
*   Increased refresh rate of ControlScreen to enhance capturing of key presses 


## [1.0.0b2] - 2017-06-12
### NEW
*	Gammatron stimulus
*	Pixel-shaded picture stimulus (not yet documented)
* 	PictureWithGaussianPatch stimulus (not yet documented)
*	Behavioral data from a session is now stored in a unique folder without
 	subfolders for experiment and session.
*	Temporal frequencies of several stimuli are now expressed in cycles per s
*	ARCADE version is printed in log files if Git is installed

### FIXED
*	Missing nanmax function in PLTReactionTime
*	Month and day were swapped in date string


## [1.0.0b1] - 2017-05-31
### NEW
* 	64-bit support: ARCADE runs on 64-bit MATLAB only (currently only 2014a). 
	This allows for very long sessions (>9000 trials) and slightly improves 
	performance.
* 	Rewritten stimulus classes: stimulus definition has been simplified and
	can now be easily tested outside a running session. This unfortunately means 
	existing task scripts have to be adapted. See tutorial documentation for an 
	overview.
*	Documentation of all user-oriented functions and classes as well as tutorial
	documentation as been added.
*	New EyeServers: ARCADE provides now interfaces for eye tracking via 
    (1) National Instruments Cards (SGLNiEyeServer), (2) ethernet from Eyelink 
    SR 1000/2000 (SGLEylinkEyeServer) and (3) a test eye signal for debugging 
    (SGLTestEyeServer). Currently this has to be configured by manually changing 
    line 44 of SGLEyeServerProc.m
*	Laptop mode: when no national instruments card can be detected, eventmarkers
    and reward will not be send out.
*	No MATLAB toolboxes are required to run ARCADE
*	Store events to disk: timestamps of eventmarkers are recorded in separate 
	.evt file. The file can be read with readEvtFile.m
*	New file naming scheme: behavioral data files are now named according to 
	the pattern subject_day_experiment_session
*	In case of crashing, the behavioral .esi and .hdr files can be converted to
    a MATLAB file using convertEsiFile.m
*	Eye position is now shared among processes via kernel32 NamedSharedMemory
*	Starting and stopping of data acquisition is now triggered via kernel32 Events 
* 	The CoreControlScreenPipe was simplified and now only transfers the trial data
*	Processes are now managed using the MATLAB Java Runtime with processManager.m
*	SGLNiEyeServer now samples at a fixed rate
*	user32 functionality has been removed

### FIXED
*	Occasional freezing of ARCADE should not happen anymore. On pipe write error, 
    the Core process continued to write instead of raising an error. This may 
    have cause the hangups.
* 	Several minor bugs.
